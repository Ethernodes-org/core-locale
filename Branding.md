## How (not) to spell CranePay

This file should contain branding information for translators. Please team, replace my mini-rant with proper branding info. ;)

Right now the spelling of CcranePpay is a mess. 
In website, chat, logo, language files it is sometimes "Cranepay", usually "cranepay", sometimes "CranePay".

I know there are a lot of things to take care of during the transition, but get that right from the start. 
Inconsistent spelling of a brand name just looks amateurish.
